                    <h5>This is my Technology Page. Welcome to the branch of<br />
                        the website in which i explain all the cool coding and<br />
                        all the programs behind it.</h5>
                    <p>The technology we are using on these pages is incredibly<br />
                       complex, but to think about it, there are only three main<br />
                       programs we use.<br />
                       <br />
                       HTML is where the main coding takes place. The HTML is where<br />
                       all the main things like text, links, and columns are placed<br />
                       and configured. If you want a paragraph describing HTML in your <br />
                       website, that is where you'd want to go.<br />
                       <br />
                       CSS is basically the makeup and the accessories of the website.<br />
                       In this program, you are able to add background images, change <br />
                       text color, and  create borders and margins.<br />
                       <br />
                       Bootstrap is the latest and newest of the three that iv'e used <br />
                       so far. In this program, you can organize and customize the website.<br />
                       You can create borders and customize said border. you can create <br />
                       rows and colomns to organize your website with.<br />
